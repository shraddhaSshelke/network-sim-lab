# Network Simulation Lab

This project simulates basic packet routing across a virtual network using Python. Each router has a static routing table, and packets log their hops through the network.

##  How It Works

- Routers forward packets based on destination IPs in their routing table.
- Each hop is logged.
- Final output shows the path the packet took.

##  Tech

- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Routing Simulation
- CLI output
